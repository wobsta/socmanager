socmanager
==========

Welcome to socmanager, a member management software for a choir. This
software is used to serve http://www.schwaebischer-oratorienchor.de/.
It contains both the actual server software and the content of the
website.

For ease the socmanager repository also contains some third party
javascript code, namely:

 * jquery, http://jquery.com/
 * jquery-ui, http://jqueryui.com/
 * jquery quicksearch, http://www.lomalogue.com/jquery/quicksearch/
 * jquery timer, http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Timer
 * jquery scrollTo, http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
 * jquery annotate, http://code.google.com/p/jquery-image-annotate/

The aforementioned packages are *not* part of socmanager and are
included here for convenience only. socmanager can be run without
those parts (with some features becoming unavailable).

Some material on the website like figures in the program booklets are
licensed as stated along with the content.


Requirements
------------

At our best knowledge the following infrastructure is required:

 * Python (2.x where x >= 5; on Python 2.5 simplejson is required)
 * web.py (0.34)
 * SQLAlchemy (0.x where x >= 5)
 * PostgreSQL 8.4 or later (*) and a database adapter like psycopg2
 * PIL (for photo management only, any recent version should work,
   jpeg decoder/encoder required)

(*) PostgreSQL versions 8.3 (and below?) can be used after defining
the following aggregate function:

  CREATE AGGREGATE array_agg (anyelement)
  (
    sfunc = array_append,
    stype = anyarray,
    initcond = '{}'
  );
